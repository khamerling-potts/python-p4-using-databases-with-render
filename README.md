<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In the last lesson, we learned how to deploy a Flask API on Render, including a
database. We touched on some issues with Render's free tier, and on using PSQL
to run some of the database commands. In this lesson, we will review some of
that material and go into greater detail about using databases with Render.</p>

<p>We recommend that as you go through this lesson, you pay attention to what you
can do in Render and what you need to use PSQL to accomplish. In particular,
PSQL will allow you to interact with any app-specific databases you add within
your PostgreSQL instance. Your goal for this lesson should be to gain a basic
understanding of the commands and utilities covered. You can return to this
lesson and use it as a reference as needed moving forward.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Using PSQL to execute database commands</h2>

<p>Render makes it pretty easy to accomplish certain database tasks, but there are
a number of additional helpful tasks that can't be done through the browser
interface. For these, we'll use the PostgreSQL interactive terminal,
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span><code>psql</code></span><span class="external_link_icon" style="margin-inline-start: 5px; display: inline-block; text-indent: initial; " role="presentation"><svg viewBox="0 0 1920 1920" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="width:1em; height:1em; vertical-align:middle; fill:currentColor">

<p>PSQL is a very helpful tool that allows us to connect to the remote database
from our terminal and run certain <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-META-COMMANDS" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>"meta-commands"</span><span class="external_link_icon" style="margin-inline-start: 5px; display: inline-block; text-indent: initial; " role="presentation"><svg viewBox="0 0 1920 1920" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="width:1em; height:1em; vertical-align:middle; fill:currentColor">

<span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a> that take the
place of running a SQL query (e.g., list our databases; list the data tables in
a database). It also includes some useful "utility" commands (e.g., backup a
database; restore a database). Finally, we can run SQL commands directly from
PSQL.</p>

<p>To get into PSQL, go to your PostgreSQL instance page in the Render dashboard,
scroll down to the "Connections" section, and copy the "PSQL Command".</p>

<p><img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/6130/deploy_flask_app/psql.png" alt="psql command link from render page"></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can click "Connect" in the upper right corner, then click
"External Connection" and copy the command from there.</p>

<p>Go to your terminal, paste in the command and press enter. You should now see
the <code>psql</code> command prompt, <code>my_database=&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> As you're working with PSQL, be aware that if it's idle for a while,
the connection will time out. If that happens, when you try to run a command,
there will be a delay and then you'll see the following message:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight console"><code><span class="go">could not receive data from server: Operation timed out
SSL SYSCALL error: Operation timed out
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To reconnect, run the quit command (<code>\q</code>) then, from the terminal prompt, press
the up arrow to access the PSQL command and hit enter.</p>

<h3>Listing Databases</h3>

<p>In the previous lesson, you created a PostgreSQL instance <code>my_database</code> to store
all of your apps' databases. The free tier only allows you to create one
database server instance, although you were able to create another database
named <code>bird_app_db</code> within it by using the <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> command. Let's
explore some other PSQL commands.</p>

<p>To list the databases on your PostgreSQL instance, run the <code>\l</code> meta-command.
You should see something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight console"><code><span class="gp">my_database=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="se">\l</span>
<span class="go">                                           List of databases
       Name       |         Owner         | Encoding |  Collate   |   Ctype    |   Access privileges
------------------+------------------+----------+------------+------------+-----------------------
 bird_app_db      | my_database_user | UTF8     | en_US.UTF8 | en_US.UTF8 |
 my_database      | my_database_user | UTF8     | en_US.UTF8 | en_US.UTF8 |
 postgres         | postgres              | UTF8     | en_US.UTF8 | en_US.UTF8 |
 template0        | postgres              | UTF8     | en_US.UTF8 | en_US.UTF8 | =c/postgres          +
                  |                       |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
 template1        | postgres              | UTF8     | en_US.UTF8 | en_US.UTF8 | =c/postgres          +
                  |                       |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
(5 rows)
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here you can see a list of databases, including some that were created
automatically by Postgres (the ones with <code>postgres</code> as the owner), and some that
were created by the user. The <code>my_database</code> database is the name of the
PostgreSQL instance; you can tell because the associated user
(<code>my_database_user</code>) is the owner of all of the user-created databases. The
remaining user-created databases are associated with particular apps. (See the
"Creating Multiple Databases within a PostgreSQL Instance" section below for
instructions on how to create app-specific databases under the umbrella of your
PostgreSQL instance.)</p>

<h3>Listing Data Tables</h3>

<p>To list the data tables in the currently selected database (in our case,
<code>my_db_instance</code>), run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight console"><code><span class="go">\dt
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Because we don't have any data tables associated with our PostgreSQL instance
directly, we get the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight console"><code><span class="go">Did not find any relations.
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To see the tables associated with one of our apps, we first need to switch to
the app's database.</p>

<h3>Switching to a Different Database</h3>

<p>To switch to the <code>bird_app_db</code> that we created in the last lesson, we'll type
the command <code>\c bird_app_db</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight console"><code><span class="gp">my_database=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="se">\c</span> bird_app_db
</code></pre></div>
<p>You should see something similar to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight console"><code><span class="go">
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, bits: 128, compression: off)
You are now connected to database "bird_app_db" as user "my_database_user".
</span><span class="gp">bird_app_db=&gt;</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>c</code> stands for connect. The PSQL command prompt will now show <code>bird_app_db</code>
rather than <code>my_database</code>.</p>

<p>Now if we enter the command <code>\dt</code> again, we'll see something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight console"><code><span class="gp"> bird_app_db=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="se">\d</span>t
<span class="go">                    List of relations
 Schema |      Name       | Type  |         Owner
--------+-----------------+-------+-----------------------
 public | alembic_version | table | my_database_user
 public | birds           | table | my_database_user
(2 rows)
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that we can see our <code>birds</code> table in the second row.</p>

<h3>Quitting PSQL</h3>

<p>To exit PSQL and get back to your terminal prompt, run the <code>\q</code> command.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Using Seed Data with a Database</h2>

<p>You may recall that in the last lesson, in order to deploy our app, we created
the bulk of our data with a seed file. We ran <code>python seed.py</code> to seed the
database. Whenever you add the seed data, just push up the changes to GitHub and
re-deploy your app. Recall that seed scripts should begin with a deletion of
existing data to avoid duplicating the data.</p>

<p>If you forget to do that, or if you need to start fresh for some other reason,
you can reset the database. We'll learn how to do that a bit later in this
lesson.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Backing Up and Recreating Your Databases on Render</h2>

<p>We mentioned in the last lesson that, with Render's free tier, your PostgreSQL
instance and any additional databases you've created on it will expire after 90
days. This means that, before the end of the 90 days, you will need to back up
your databases, delete the PostgreSQL instance from Render, create a new
PostgreSQL instance, and populate it from the database backups. Render should
send an email warning you that your database will be expiring soon.</p>

<p>Before we launch into the instructions for backing up and recreating your Render
PostgreSQL instance, let's take a closer look at the PSQL connection string. Go
ahead and copy the "PSQL Command" from the Render dashboard then paste it into a
new file in your text editor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Be careful not to store any of the PSQL commands inside a project
repo. Those commands contain secure information so you don't want them to be
deployed to GitHub accidentally!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The connection string will look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>PGPASSWORD=############# psql -h ################-postgres.render.com -U my_database_user my_database
</code></pre></div>
<p>The first element is the password for your database, which will be a
32-character string. Next is the command you're running, in this case, <code>psql</code>.
The next component is the host (indicated by the <code>-h</code> flag), which will end with
"-postgres.render.com". Next is the name of the database user (indicated by the
<code>-U</code> flag), followed, finally, by the name of the database itself.</p>

<p>Note that the username and database name in the PSQL command above match the
entry for the PostgreSQL instance in the list of databases we printed earlier in
this lesson.</p>

<p>We discovered earlier that the main database in the PostgreSQL instance,
<code>my_database</code>, does not contain any data. Therefore, we just need to back up the
database we've created, <code>bird_app_db</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Technically, we don't need to back up our bird app either, because all
the records come from our seed data — there is no way for users to add, change
or delete records. This means all we need to do to restore the database is
re-run the seed command. For purposes of illustration, however, we'll go ahead
and go through the process of backing it up.</p>

<h3>Backing Up Our Databases</h3>

<p>To create a backup, we're going to modify the PSQL connection string to run
PSQL's <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/app-pgdump.html" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span><code>pg_dump</code></span><span class="external_link_icon" style="margin-inline-start: 5px; display: inline-block; text-indent: initial; " role="presentation"><svg viewBox="0 0 1920 1920" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="width:1em; height:1em; vertical-align:middle; fill:currentColor">

</svg>
<span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a> utility command. We'll do that once for each
database we need to back up, starting with <code>bird_app_db</code>. We recommend making
the edits to the string in your text editor then copy/pasting it into the
terminal when you're done. (But remember not to push it up to Github!)</p>

<p>The first part of the string, the password, will remain the same. The <code>psql</code>
command should be updated to <code>pg_dump</code> instead. The host and username should
also stay the same. After that, we'll add the following options:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nt">--format</span><span class="o">=</span>custom <span class="nt">--no-acl</span> <span class="nt">--no-owner</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The final component of the original connection string is the name of the
PostgreSQL instance, <code>my_database</code>. We'll replace that name with <code>bird_app_db</code>
instead. After that, we'll add a <code>&gt;</code> to indicate that we want the results of the
command to be written to a file, followed by the name we want to use for the
backup file, with the <code>.sql</code> extension:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code>bird_app_db <span class="o">&gt;</span> bird_app_db.sql
</code></pre></div>
<p>The updated string will look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">PGPASSWORD</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="c">############# pg_dump -h ################-postgres.render.com -U my_database_user --format=custom --no-acl --no-owner bird_app_db &gt; bird_app_db.sql</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we've created the command, we'll copy/paste it into the terminal (not
PSQL) and run it. Make sure you're not inside a directory that's a git repo
first to ensure the backup file doesn't get pushed to GitHub. The command will
not print any output, but if we run <code>ls</code>, we'll see the newly-created <code>.sql</code>
file in the current directory.</p>

<p>Now that we've backed up our database, the next step is to delete the current
PostgreSQL instance and create a new one.</p>

<h3>Replacing the Expiring PostgreSQL Instance</h3>

<p>To delete the PostgreSQL instance, go to the database page on the Render
dashboard. Scroll to the bottom of the page, then click "Delete Database" and
follow the instructions.</p>

<p>Next, we'll create a new PostgreSQL instance by clicking the "New +" button and
selecting PostgreSQL. Provide a name for the new instance (e.g., <code>my_database</code>),
then scroll down to the bottom of the page, and click "Create Database."</p>

<p>You need to copy the PSQL connection string from this database instance, since
it is different from the previous version.</p>

<h3>Restoring the Databases to the New Instance</h3>

<p>Once the new instance has been created, the next step is to create the
app-specific databases within that instance.</p>

<p>First we need to execute the PSQL connection string for the new PostgreSQL
instance to launch the interactive terminal. Next, we'll run the CREATE DATABASE
commands for each of the databases (we're using the same database names but you
can use different names if you prefer):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight console"><code><span class="gp">my_database=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span>CREATE DATABASE bird_app_db<span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once that's done, we can exit PSQL with the <code>\q</code> command.</p>

<p>Now we're ready to work on building the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/app-pgrestore.html" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span><code>pg_restore</code></span><span class="external_link_icon" style="margin-inline-start: 5px; display: inline-block; text-indent: initial; " role="presentation"><svg viewBox="0 0 1920 1920" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="width:1em; height:1em; vertical-align:middle; fill:currentColor">

</svg>
<span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a> command. Once
again, we recommend pasting the connection string into your text editor and
editing it there.</p>

<p>The command will consist of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The database password.</li>
<li>The <code>pg_restore</code> command.</li>
<li>The host.</li>
<li>The user.</li>
<li>The options: <code>--verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>-d</code> flag (for <code>dbname</code>) followed by the name of the new database you're
restoring the data to.</li>
<li>The name of the <code>.sql</code> file you're restoring from.</li>
</ul>

<p>The final string for the bird app will look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>PGPASSWORD=################ pg_restore -h #################-postgres.render.com -U my_database_user --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -d bird_app_db bird_app_db.sql
</code></pre></div>
<p>When we run the command in the terminal, we'll see a flurry of activity as it
creates the database tables. You may see some error messages about dropping
tables, which you can ignore.</p>

<h3>Connecting the New Databases to Your Web Services</h3>

<p>The final step in the process is to update each app's Web Service so that it
points to the newly-restored database.</p>

<p>From the Render dashboard, we'll select the bird app, then click "Environment"
in the nav on the left. Next, we delete the value associated with the
DATABASE_URL key and replace it with the Internal URL for the new instance.
Remember that we want to connect to the bird app database, not the instance
itself, so you need to remove the name of the PostgreSQL instance from the end
of the URL and replace it with the name of the bird app database. You also need
to update the protocol to <code>postgresql</code>. It should look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code>postgresql://my_database_user:#################################################/bird_app_db
</code></pre></div>
<p>After we've saved the change, the web service will redeploy. When we click the
app's URL for the <code>/birds</code> route, we should see the JSON for the list of birds.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Resetting an Existing Database</h2>

<p>If you need to reset a database for some reason — say you have duplicate data —
all you need to do is drop the database and recreate it.</p>

<p>There are two cases to consider. The first is if the database you need to reset
is the PostgreSQL instance itself (i.e., if you only have a single app
deployed). In this case, you would simply delete and recreate the instance in
Render, then connect the new instance to the web service for the app and
redeploy it.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you need to reset a database <em>within</em> your PostgreSQL
instance and not the instance itself, you can do that using PSQL:</p>

<ol>
<li>Execute the PSQL command for your PostgreSQL instance in the terminal.</li>
<li>Run the SQL command to drop the database: <code>DROP DATABASE database_name;</code>. You
should see 'DROP DATABASE' echoed in the terminal. If you don't, make sure
you included the semicolon and that your PSQL connection hasn't timed out.</li>
<li>Run the SQL command to create the new database:
<code>CREATE DATABASE database_name;</code></li>
<li>In Render, connect the web service for the app to the new database and
redeploy. If you used the same name for the database, you'll just need to
redeploy.</li>
</ol>

<p>Optionally, with either approach, you can also re-seed your database if you
choose.</p>

<p>That's it!</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you learned some important database tasks that can be performed
using the Render dashboard, and how to use PSQL to supplement those actions. In
particular, familiarity with PSQL will be very helpful for you if you want to
deploy multiple apps with databases to Render. You've also learned how to handle
the situation when your Render PostgreSQL instance is approaching its expiration
date.</p>

<p>In the next lesson, we'll work on deploying a more complex application with a
Flask API backend and a React frontend, and talk through some of the challenges
of running these two applications together.</p>

<h2>Check For Understanding</h2>

<p>Before you move on, make sure you can answer the following questions:</p>

<details>
  <summary>
    <em>1. What database actions can be completed in the Render web app?</em>
  </summary>

  <p>Creating or deleting a PostgreSQL instance.</p>
</details>

<p><br></p>

<details>
  <summary>
    <em>2. What database actions require the PSQL interactive terminal?</em>
  </summary>

  <p>Running “meta-commands” (e.g., listing databases and data tables),
      “utility” commands (e.g., pg_backup, pg_restore), and SQL commands.</p>
</details>

<p><br></p>

<details>
  <summary>
    <em>3. What issue do you need to be aware of when using seed data for your
        database? How can you address the situation?</em>
  </summary>

  <p>If the <code>python seed.py</code> command is included in a build script
     and there is seed data in seed.py, the database will be seeded each time
     the app is updated, resulting in duplicate data.</p>

  <p>You can avoid this by either removing the seed command from the build
     script, or removing the seed data from seed.py , after the database has
     been seeded initially. If you do wind up with duplicate data, you can reset
     the database.</p>

  <p>You can also avoid this by starting your seed.py script with a deletion of
     all data in your database.</p>
